The use of double underscores around names in Python (e.g., __name__, __init__, __call__, etc.) is a part of Python's "special methods" or "magic methods" convention. 

These are system-defined names that have a special meaning and behavior in the Python language. 

The double underscores are used to indicate that the name is reserved for Python's internal use, 

and that it serves a specific, predefined role in the language.
